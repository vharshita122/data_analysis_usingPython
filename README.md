📌 Coursera Dataset Analysis: Project Summary
This project analyzes Coursera course data to uncover trends in course popularity, ratings, reviews, and skills. The analysis follows these steps:

1️⃣ Data Cleaning 🧹
✔ Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
✔ Checked for missing values and handled them by filling or dropping.
✔ Converted data types:

course_students_enrolled (removed commas, converted to numbers).
Review Count (converted ‘K’ notation to thousands).
Ratings (ensured as float).
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
✔ Descriptive Statistics: Used df.describe() to understand numerical distributions.
✔ Visualizations:

Course Popularity: Top 10 most enrolled courses (bar chart).
Ratings Distribution: Histogram to see how courses are rated.
Difficulty Level: Count plot to check how courses are categorized.
Top Organizations: Bar chart showing most popular course providers.
Skills Analysis: Word cloud for most in-demand skills.
Correlation Heatmap: Checked relationships between ratings, reviews, and enrollments.
3️⃣ Key Insights & Conclusion 🔍
✅ Highly enrolled courses get more reviews but not necessarily better ratings.
✅ Beginner-level courses dominate the platform.
✅ Google and IBM provide the most popular courses.
✅ Data-related skills (Python, SQL, Data Analysis) are in high demand.

This analysis helps in understanding trends in online education, guiding learners toward the most valuable courses! 🚀
